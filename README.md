### Section 2: Projects

Throughout this course, I've made many projects, some with and without the guidance of video lectures. Since there are too many small projects, I'll only showcase some notable ones below.   

#### 2.1 Keeper App
This is a pure front-end note taking app made to practise React.js. Since backend is not implemented, data cannot be persisted past any one session. However, through this project, I learnt alot about **React.js** and **Material UI**, a React component library.

Check out the application [here](https://oscarqjh.github.io/2023WebDevBootcamp-KeeperApp/).    
Source code can be found [here](https://github.com/oscarqjh/2023WebDevBootcamp-KeeperApp).   

#### 2.2 Portfolio Website
This portfolio website is made as part of capstone project 2 of the course. Through this project, I've learned to effectively use **Bootstrap** components to make a frontend only website.

#### 2.3 Dice Game
This is a simple dice roller game made to practise basic **HTML, CSS and Javascript**.

#### 2.4 Simon Game
This is a pure front-end arcade game made to practise **Javascript**. It is pretty fun.

Source code can be found [here](https://github.com/oscarqjh/2023WebDevBootcamp-SimonGame).   

#### 2.5 Todo List Website
This is a website to make your to-do list. This is the first proper project made with backend capability using **MongoDB**, meaning that data can be persisted past each session. Note: However since I am using free-tier to host the website on render, it can take a long time for the website to load.
